                          PROJECT TOPAZ LICENSE
                       Version 1, 01 December 2019

 Copyright (C) 2019 Project Topaz.

                                Preamble

  The Project Topaz License governs your usage or distribution
of Project Topaz, a code base that attempts to emulate an online server
for the online video game Final Fantasy XI (Copyright Square Enix, Co.)

  Another project which also aims to be such an emulator, Darkstar Project,
is licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 3. However, under
the terms of the GPLv3, network usage does not count as distribution.
If it did, people who operate servers running the Program would be required 
to offer their personal modifications to users interacting with it.

  We feel that lacking this requirement ultimately harms the broader community 
of developers who work on server emulators. Some server operators choose to 
"compete" with other operators by taking the code base we all share, making 
proprietary modifications to emulate additional features of the "retail 
servers" which currently do not exist in the shared code base, and then 
not share those features back with the community of developers.

  This behavior leads to the community constantly "re-inventing the wheel",
wasting time that could have otherwise been spent developing entirely new
features for the project in advance of our common goals. It also disheartens
developers who would share their modifications with the community, but 
feel discouraged when their code is taken by a server operator, modified
with additional improvements, but kept privately as an "edge" over others,
including the original developer of the feature.

  For these reasons, Project Topaz instead intends to be licensed primarily 
under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3, which 
stipulates that use of a Program over a network qualifies as distribution, 
and that the source code of the modified Program needs to be offered to
users interacting with the Program.

  However, due to the nature of running a private server, there are times
which a server operator may reasonably wish to not share their entire 
source code. As examples, the server operator may wish to include custom 
easter eggs, or run a community event based on players discovering hidden 
things. These things would be trivial for players to discover if the
entire server source code were available to public view.

  To both provide special exemptions in those cases, and to account for 
source code that we have have combined from Darkstar Project which is 
licensed under GPLv3 (that we can not relicense as AGPLv3), Project 
Topaz releases its source code under this special license. This license 
states the requirements of these two GNU licenses, GPLv3 and AGPLv3, 
in how they pertain to parts of this combined source code. The license 
also grants, for source code which is the work of Project Topaz, select 
Additional Permissions to give server operators additional freedoms, 
and to encourage adoption of the project.

  The precise terms and conditions for using, copying, distribution and
modification of Project Topaz follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 1 of the Project Topaz License Agreement.

  "GNU GPLv3", "GPLv3", and "GPL" refer to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License. A copy should have been included in the source code you  
have received in a file named "GPL3". If not, you may find a copy online 
at <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  "GNU AGPLv3", "AGPLv3", and "AGPL" refer to version 3 of the GNU Affero 
General Public License. A copy should have been included in the source code 
you have received in a file named "AGPL3". If not, you may find a copy 
online at <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The terms "Copyright", "Program", "modify", and "convey" are as defined 
in version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Source code" is as defined in version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Commit" refers to modifications to the Program which are packaged, 
transmitted, and patched into the source code as "Git Commits" utilizing 
the Git distributed version control system. A commit being governed by 
a license means all source code and modifications within that commit 
package are subject to that license.

  "Private server" refers to a computer or network system running any instance 
of Project Topaz, in whole or in part, which accepts connections or commands 
from users other than one physically present at the computer system. 
Computer or network systems which pass or forward commands to any instance
of Project Topaz are considered part of the same private server, regardless 
of how Project Topaz instances or computer systems are physically distributed.

  "Retail" and "Retail server" refer to the online servers for the 
video game Final Fantasy XI, owned and copyright by Square Enix, Co. which 
their subscribers can connect to. If these servers are no longer online 
at the time this license is granted, it refers to their servers as they 
were immediately prior to being taken offline, or otherwise barred from 
access by the general public.

  "Retail behavior" means the features of, interaction with, output of, 
or delayed effects resulting from user interaction which would occur 
on a retail server.

  "Non-retail" and "Non-retail modification" refer to modifications of
the Program which do not seek to emulate retail behavior. 

  Modifications seeking to emulate, or give the appearance of emulating,  
a behavior of a retail server are not non-retail modifications, even if 
the modification is inaccurate to retail behavior, unless the modified 
behavior is distinguishable from the retail behavior to a person 
person who only has a cursory knowledge of the retail behavior.

  As examples, a modification changing the game characters which a 
player can interact with in the equivalent game area on retail, or 
making a game character say things they never would on retail, would be
considered a non-retail modification. A difference in combat statistics 
of a game monster between how they are on retail and how they are on 
a private server is not considered a non-retail modification, unless 
the difference in statistics would be immediately apparent to a player 
fighting that game monster on both servers.

  "Player interface" means an interface that a user connecting to a 
private server visibly sees on a computer screen, which can relay text, 
that a user is capable of reading or viewing the text history of from 
within the same interface.

  1. Project Repository.

  Project Topaz is a distributively developed project, which takes 
contributions from many developers all over the world. It utilizes 
Git, a distributed version control system, for its development. 
The current source code for the project is available online at: 
<https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz>

  As part of using Git, code contributions by developers can be 
be tracked and attributed on an individual level. If you 
obtained this source code by cloning it from GitHub, you can use 
any number of Git clients found online to parse this information.

  If instead you obtained this source code by downloading it 
without cloning, or were given it by a third party, and the archive 
you received lacks this Git information, you can and are encouraged 
to view this information on our GitHub repository.

  We distinguish which parts of Project Topaz's source code are 
governed by the GPLv3, and which are governed by the AGPLv3, based on 
the author and the origin of the commit.

  2. Basic License Terms.

  Project Topaz is a combined work of source code licensed under
both the GPLv3, and the AGPLv3 with Additional Terms we are adding 
through Section 7 Additional Terms of both licenses. These Additional 
Terms are defined later in this license document.

  All Git commits which originate from Darkstar Project, either 
before or after Project Topaz's initial repository commit on 
GitHub, are governed by the GPLv3, unless the owner of the copyright 
for the source code has agreed to our Limited Contributor License 
Agreement. This Agreement can be found either included with this 
source code in the CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT file, or available 
online in our GitHub repository.

  As per the terms of our Limited Contributor License Agreement, 
source code contributions by authors who have agreed to the 
agreement are instead licensed under this Project Topaz License, 
which licenses to you the right to use, modify, and convey all 
such material under the AGPLv3 supplemented with Additional 
Terms defined later in this license document.

  A list of developers who have agreed to our Limited Contributor
License Agreement can be found either on our GitHub repository's 
wiki, or in the AUTHORS file, included with this source code or 
available online in our GitHub repository.

  Modifications you make to the source code are governed by the 
license which the original work was licensed under. However, per 
Section 13 of both the GPLv3 and the AGPLv3, all modifications 
you make to this Program, or works you combine with this 
Program, are subject to the requirements of the AGPLv3 concerning 
interaction through a network.

  3. Additional Terms.

  Through Section 7, Additional Terms of the AGPLv3, we are adding
the following additional terms to our material:

    a) ADDITIONAL PERMISSIONS.
	Project Topaz grants you an additional permission 
	exempting you from being bound by Section 13 Remote Network
	Interaction of the AGPLv3, for modifications you make to the
	Program, if the modification is:

      i. Necessary for the basic operation of the server. Examples 
	  include basic server configuration, network connection 
	  configuration, and database access information; or

	  ii. A non-retail modification, which can not reasonably be
	  considered a modification with the purpose of improving server 
	  stability, performance, or security; or

	  iii. A modification to the database import files included
	  with the source code, if the modification can be reasonably 
	  considered to necessitate secrecy for the purpose of player 
	  surprise or discovery

	b) ATTRIBUTION.
	If you convey this Program to a recipient, you must preserve 
	and also convey to the recipient any existing lists of 
	Program authors and contributors, such as those displayed by 
	the Program, or those found in an AUTHORS file. All existing 
	dates, and all existing copyright notices must also be retained.
	
	As an exception to the above, you may alter any attributions 
	or notices added by Project Topaz to the extent required to 
	remedy known factual inaccuracies.

	If you modify and convey this Program, you are permitted to 
	to add yourself to such lists. You are also permitted to
	rename any attribution files, so long as the filename still 
	clearly indicates that the authors listed in the file 
	contributed to the modified Program. If this is done, you must 
	include a notice in any new author attribution files you 
	create stating the following:
	"Contributors to Project Topaz, upon which this Program is based, 
	 can be found: " followed by the path to original file.

    c) MISREPRESENTATION.
	The origin of this Program must not be misrepresented. You
	shall not claim, suggest, nor imply you wrote this Program, 
	in whole or in part, unless you are the original author for 
	the distinct part for which you claim to be the author.

	If you convey modified versions of this Program, you may not 
	misrepresent that modified Program as being "Project Topaz", 
	unless that modified Program is being conveyed back to 
	Project Topaz with the intention of the modification's inclusion 
	into the project.
	
	If you convey modified versions to recipients other than Project 
	Topaz, you shall mark the material such that any users interacting 
	with the Program are given notice - through an applicable player 
	interface of your choosing - that the Program has been modified 
	from its original version, unless that modification was necessary 
	for the basic operation of the server.

  4. Revised Versions.

  Project Topaz may publish new or revised versions of this license. 
These new versions will be similar in spirit, but may differ to address 
new problems or concerns with the project by modifying the additional
permissions we grant to you, or modify the restrictions imposed on you,  
to the extent allowed under AGPLv3 Section 7, Additional Terms.

  The license for which you may use the Program is the one you 
received along with a copy of this source code, or at your option, 
any later version of the Project Topaz License Agreement that has 
been published by Project Topaz. However, no additional obligations 
are imposed upon authors or copyright holders due to your choice 
in following a later version of this license.
