Bug Reports
========
Old reports can be found here: http://bugs.dspt.info/

We are now using the issue tracker that is built into Github for all new bug reports and such.
You can find the tracker here: https://github.com/DarkstarProject/darkstar/issues

Make sure both FFXI and the server are fully updated (and servers have been rebuilt with the latest code prior to the bug) or check the commit log since your last known update to see if the bug has already been fixed before submitting a new bug report (oh and remember to search to see if your issue has already been reported).

For any server crashing bugs, try to include a crashdump if possible, with the ```exe```, ```pdb```, and ```dmp``` file (see https://wiki.dspt.info/index.php/How_to_Dump) - including the ```log``` is optional, but it does help us debug crashes.

Bug reports should include steps to reproduce the bug.

Pull Requests
========
Commits should contain a descriptive name for what you are modifying

Remember to check back for any feedback, and drop a comment once requested changes have been made (if there are any).


Please *test your code* before committing changes/submitting a pull request.
