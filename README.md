**If you're switching to Project Topaz from Darkstar Project, portions of our project may be governed by the [GNU AGPLv3](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/master/AGPL3) instead of the [GNU GPLv3](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/master/GPL3). This may require your server source code to be made available to users.**

**Any such portions will be clearly marked as being governed by the AGPLv3 in all relevant source files. Any source code not so marked is instead governed by the GPLv3, and may be used or modified without offering source to connecting users, provided it is not combined with any AGPLv3 source code. See Section 13 of both the [GPLv3](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/master/GPL3#L552) and [AGPLv3](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/master/AGPL3#L540) for more information, and the [Project Topaz License](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/master/LICENSE) for [additional permissions](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/master/LICENSE#L182) which may exempt you from this requirement.**

You can find the tracker here: https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/issues

Make sure both your FFXI client and the Topaz server are fully updated (and servers have been rebuilt with the latest code), to check the commit log since your last known update to see if the bug has already been fixed, and to use GitHub's search to see if the bug already been reported, before submitting a new bug report.

Bug reports should include steps to reproduce the bug.

We do take issues detailing unimplemented features _if_ the feature is _retail behavior_, and the issue report adequetly covers everything about that feature which is missing.
