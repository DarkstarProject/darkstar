These need to be used together.  Teleport out, change pos, teleport in.
Used by mobs such as Ark Angel TT, which teleports around the battlefield instead of moving.  Target isn't lost on AA TT.
Not to be confused with worms moving, which is completely different.  Costume and walk around.
Teleport out: 639, 674, 689
Teleport in: ???, 675, 690
