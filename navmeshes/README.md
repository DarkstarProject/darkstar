Navmeshes allow mobs to roam around, avoid walls when chasing players and
not aggro players through walls. To enable this feature, download this repo
https://github.com/DarkstarProject/xiNavmeshes and place the contents of the
`navmeshes/` directory inside this one.

**Note:** You can disable a navmesh for a zone by just deleting the file.
