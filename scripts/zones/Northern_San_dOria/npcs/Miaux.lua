-- accept the task? Yes/No dialog Thank you.  It would mean so much to me."

-- "Miaux : Here, Ranchuriome.  <Character> is the reason we have this!"
-- Ranchuriome : "Excellent! You managed to find one.  Now I can start on those repairs.  I'll
-- have it ready for you by dinnertime."
-- Ranchuriome : "I've really been feeling my years lately... No matter.  I'm sure I'll perk up
-- once I start working."
-- Miaux : "I'm most grateful to you!"
-- 72 Miaux : "You don't see many people with that kind of integrity around anymore.  If my
-- father was still alive, they would have struck up a solid friendship, I'm sure."
-- 66 Miaux : "Oh, that shiny earring came in handy after all?  That's wonderful!  I'm glad
-- I could help someone out in the same way that you and Ranchuriome helped me.

-- on helping people in a way that's more within my capabilities."
-- (10)10 Miaux : "Thanks to your help, my father's breastplate is looking like new, but...
-- That nice old man, Ranchuriome, has passed away.
-- Miaux : "I can't help but think it's my fault in some way...that the repairs he did for me were
-- too strenuous.  When I attended the funeral to pay my respects, though, his features seemed to
-- be at peace."
-- (67)67 Miaux : "I attended Ranchuriome's funeral to pay my respects and express my thanks for
-- his kindness.  During the ceremony, I was distracted by an unusal lady among the mourners.
-- Miaux : "Something about this woman seemed out of place.  I tried to follow her after the funeral
-- ended, but... I lost sight of her not long after.  I searched around, trying to find her again.
-- Instead, I came across Ranchuriome's son lying unconscious on the ground.  I tended to his wound,
-- and thankfully, he soon regained consciousness.  I found this lying nearby.
-- Miaux : "This shiny earring might be a clue as to what happened. It's probably just my overactive
-- imagination, but perhaps it will help in some way.  Here, you should hold onto it, just in case."
-- (68)68 Miaux : "A suspicious woman and a shiny earring... Probably just my overactive imagination."

-- Of course, she has only begun her rise to glory... Never before has she set foot within the Elvaan Capital...
