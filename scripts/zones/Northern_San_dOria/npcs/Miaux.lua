-- ended, but... I lost sight of her not long after.  I searched around, trying to find her again.  
-- Instead, I came across Ranchuriome's son lying unconscious on the ground.  I tended to his wound,
-- and thankfully, he soon regained consciousness.  I found this lying nearby.

-- imagination, but perhaps it will help in some way.  Here, you should hold onto it, just in case."
