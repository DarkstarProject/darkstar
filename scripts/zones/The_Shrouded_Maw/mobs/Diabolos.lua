-- TODO: CoP Diabolos
-- 1) Make the diremites in the pit all aggro said player that falls into region. Should have a respawn time of 10 seconds.
-- 2) Diremites also shouldnt follow you back to the fight area if you make it there. Should despawn and respawn instantly if all players
--    make it back to the Diabolos floor area.
-- 3) ANIMATION Packet ids for instance 2 and 3 are wrong (needs guesswork). Sounds working.
--    Update 2018-01-02 these no longer seem to work for any instance. neither animation nor sound.

-- TODO: Diabolos Prime
-- Note: Diabolos Prime fight drops all tiles at once.
